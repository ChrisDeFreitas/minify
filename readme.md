# minify

This is an single HTML page that allows Javascript code to be pasted then transpiled and minified with Babel Standalone and/or the Google Closure Compiler API.  The page contains comments to guide usage of the tools.

I put it together to simplify the entire process as I was moving between websites to accomplish various tasks and then having to refresh myself on the details of the various usages.

The code is stored here so I can get at it from different locations.  Feel free to use and modify.
